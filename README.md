### Imposter syndrome disclaimer

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be a contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to
contribute. What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code or extensive prose**.
Equality important contributions include: fixing typos and misspelled words,
suggesting or implementing small changes, or even giving feedback about the
project (including giving feedback about the contribution process). If you're
coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and assumptions
that seasoned contributors have glossed over. If you can write any code at all,
you can contribute code to open source projects. We are constantly trying out
new skills, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we
all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
