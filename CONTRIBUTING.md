# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing! It is a community-driven
project, so it's people like you that make it useful and successful.

We love contributions from community members, just like you!
There are many ways to contribute:

* Reporting bugs in the code or mistakes in the text
* Writing new material for the lesson
* Improvements to the code, text, figures, assessment, etc
* Writing code or new examples for everyone to use

If you get stuck at any point you contact us by creating an [issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/GeophysicsLibrary/gravity-disturbance/issues) at
one of the other channels mentioned below.

For more information on contributing to open source projects,
[GitHub's own guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)
is a great starting point if you are new to version control.


## Ground Rules

The goal is to maintain a diverse community that's pleasant for everyone.
**Please be considerate and respectful of others**. Everyone must abide by our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and we encourage all to read it
carefully.


## What Can I Do?

* Tackle any open [issues](https://github.com/GeophysicsLibrary/gravity-disturbance/issues)
  you wish! We have a special label for issues that beginners might want to
  try. Have a look at our
  ["good first issues" list](https://github.com/GeophysicsLibrary/gravity-disturbance/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
* Contribute material you already have. It doesn't need to be perfect! We will
  help you clean things up, test it, etc.
* Provide feedback about how we can improve the project or about your
  particular use case.


## How Can I Talk to You?

Discussion often happens in the issue tracker and in pull requests.
In addition, there is
[Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/GeophysicsLibrary/Lobby)
for the project as well.


## Reporting a Bug

When creating a new issue, please be as specific as possible.
This helps us reproduce the bug and track down its cause.
Try to include the following:

* How you ran the code
* Operating system
* Full error messages that you got
* Which file contains the mistake

Remember: the more information we have, the easier it will be for us to solve
your problem.


## Pull Requests

**Working on your first Pull Request?**
You can learn how from this *free* video series:

* [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
* Aaron Meurer's [tutorial on the git workflow](http://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/)
* [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

General guidelines for Pull Requests:

* Open an issue to describe your contributing **before making any changes**.
  This will help us keep track of who is doing what and avoid duplicated work.
* Each pull request should consist of a **small** and logical collection of
  changes.
  Larger changes should be broken down into smaller components and integrated
  separately.
  This allows us more chance for discussion and less code to review at each
  time.
  Please submit bug fixes in separate pull requests.
* Describe what your PR changes and why this is a good thing. Be as specific as
  you can. The PR description is how we keep track of the changes made to the
  project over time.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix
  (eg: .gitignore, IDE project files, etc).
* Write descriptive commit messages.  Chris Beams has written a
  [guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write good commit
  messages.
* Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your contribution.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is
  generally proportional to the size of the pull request.
* **If this is your first contribution**, be sure to add yourself to the
  [list of contributors](AUTHORS.md). We want to make sure we acknowledge the
  hard work you've generously contributed here.
